Room Name: Ship Room
Lock Type: 0
Room Description:You have landed in what appears to be a wheat field, the force from your landing has caused a large circle of flattened wheat<br>which surrounds your ship. You appear to be in a large clearing, to the far north there seems to be a large mountain range.<br>As you turn around to look south you notice that you are surrounded by a very dense forest, you will not be able to get<br>through the foliage to the east without finding a way to vaporize brush in the way. To the west there is a path leading<br>into the forest. You finally look to the south.It appears that there is a sudden drop off, it must be a cliff.<br>A supply_drop falls from the sky in front of you filled with some gear. Go unlock it and start your final bounty.

Room Name: Top of Mountain
Lock Type: 0
Room Description:It seems that almost no time has passed at all despite you walking for countless hours to make it to the top of this mountain,<br>the day/night cycle must be far longer than expected. However the walk was worth it, you can see out for hundreds of kilometers.<br>You are now able to see over the huge forest, it seems as if there is smoke bellowing up from somewhere to the south west inside<br>the forest. But what surprised you more than the smoke was what was to the west. Almost a half a dozen heads have been mounted<br>on spears, a very old practice but none less effective, this is potentially your first sign of the slaver group you’ve been hired<br>to get rid of.

Lock Type: 1
Room Description:As you walk along the path you begin to hear the sound of rushing water. Its gets louder and louder until you can barely hear<br>anything else. You finally arrive at the lake after many hours of walking. You can now see what is causing the immense noise,<br>to the north there is a huge water fall, it seems that you have been slowly descending down the mountain. To the south it<br>appears that there is whole in the side of a rock wall.

Room Name: River Basin
Lock Type: 0
Room Description:Down the hill there seems to be a river basin. As you near the water you notice a single person who is covered in blood, he must<br>be one of the slavers you have been sent to kill, he is washing his bloody hands in the river with his back turned to you. He has<br>dropped his axe and his chest plate on the ground next to you, they might prove of some use to you.

Lock Type: 0
Room Description:Remembering that you saw smoke to the south west from the mountain you figure you must be right outside of the slaver’s camp.<br>It might be wise to find a way to disguise yourself as a slaver if possible. There seems to be a shed to the west.

Room Name: Village
Lock Type: 0 
Room Description:As you venture west you begin to see what appears to have formerly been a large makeshift village, now burnt to the ground.<br>The only house left semi standing is what seems to be a chieftain’s hut of sorts. There are three men on the front steps, two<br>appear to be dead but the one in the middle is very much alive. He opens his eyes as you approach, you can feel the pain this<br>man has gone through by just looking into his eyes. At first you can see the panic in his eyes, he must think you are another<br>slaver here to kill any and all survivors, but he relaxes when he sees you carry no weapon. He motions you over.<br><br>“You… you mustn’t be from, who are you? You must help the people they took. We crashed here not too long ago. It was peaceful<br>until those fucking slavers have arrived maybe 6 cycles ago. It didn’t take them long to find us, we tried to fight them off<br>for as long as we could but ultimately they… bested us. They have not killed everyone, some they took to their camp in the forest,<br>but you will not be able to get there without some way to cut through the vines. All of our weapons have either been taken or<br>buried under the rubble but please take this, *gives you a mysterious sketchy looking gun*. When we crash landed on this planet<br>we had dropped a couple of cargo crates, one landed in a lake not too far from here however the lake is infested with deadly<br>fish which will undoubtable kill you without the proper equipment, you can use this gun to vaporize the fish and allow you<br>to retrieve that crate, I hope there is something of use in there. Now go and save my friends and family, I will try and… and.”<br>He seemed like a good man, even to his last breaths he was worried more about his people than about himself.

Lock Type: 0 
Room Description:The cave is very dimly lit, the only source of light is coming from behind an old wooden door. As you approach the door a<br>horrible smell hits your nose, the smell of rotting flesh and decayed bodies. As you near the door a figure emerges out of<br>the shadows and draws his sword.

Exit Rooms: E-Outside Cave, S-Shelter
Room Name: Shelter
Lock Type: 0
Room Description:At first you cannot get the door open, the hinges are far too old and rusted, but as you jiggle the handle a bit more you create<br>enough room for you to fit yourself through. The interior of the room is surprisingly homely, almost like a house you could be<br>proud of considering that it’s in a cave. As you enter the shelter directly in front of you is an armor stand, on the stand there<br>is leather armor in bafflingly good condition. To your right is a poorly kept kitchen, moldy yet edible food is scattered all over<br>the counters and a large rusted knife is stuck upright in a maggot infested leg of an unknown animal. Finally, to your right is<br>what once appeared to be a path leading deeper into the mine, however the path has been blocked by fallen rubble, it seems that<br>if you had some sort of explosive you could clear out the debris.

Room Description:There are less slavers than you had thought only two right in front of you, the rest must be out on patrol.

Lock Type: 0 
Room Description:You had wondered where the reminder of the slavers ad been, but not that is very obvious, they were all here in one pile,<br>very much dead. A deep rumbly voice erupts from somewhere in front of you in the pile of bodies, “Ah, another mutineer here<br>to die I presume? As you can tell I’ve already killed your fellow traitors and the one you want in charge. Now be gone I do not<br>have time to deal with you people anymore. Now leave!” As you creep forwards around the largest pile of bodies you spot him,<br>a gigantic troll wearing a fedora and a trench coat, it appears that there is a glowing tablet of sorts in one of his pockets,<br>you should probably search his body after you deal with him. Your eyes meet his, “Ah good to see that some of my former crew have<br>not lost their backbone, I will give you an honorable death, I will have you know when you were out partying I studied the blade,<br>when you were out playing sports, I mastered the blockchain and while you wasted away at the gym in pursuit of vanity,<br>I cultivated inner strength. Shinu tame no junbi!”
